# Gaza_war_2023
Visualization of rockets fired at Israel from Gaza

**Project Overview:**
- Comprehensive visualization and analysis of rockets fired at Israel from Gaza in the October 2023 war.
- Focused on three key aspects: temporal patterns of rocket launches, most targeted cities, and correlation between rocket volume and ground operations.

**Technologies Used:**
- Leveraged Python, Jupyter Notebook, Pandas, Matplotlib, sci-kit-learn's linear_model, and NumPy for data extraction.
- Generated line plots, and bar graphs to depict temporal trends and reveal insightful patterns.

**Challenges Faced:**
- Data Sourcing Challenge: Navigated hurdles in sourcing credible data on rocket launch timings, targeted cities, and ground operations through extensive web scraping.
- Topic Selection Complexity: Strategic decision-making and brainstorming were crucial to spotlight significant aspects amidst the conflict's multifaceted nature.
- Complex Visualization Creation: Crafting dual regression plots required technical finesse, meticulous coding, and iterative optimization for clarity.
**Project Conclusion:**
- Improved proficiency in Python-based data analysis and underscored the significance of data handling and visualization techniques for comprehending complex real-world scenarios.
